When converting a Nutanix cluster from ESXi to AHV, thorough cluster and VM preparation is the cornerstone of success. Adhering to all recommended best practices is crucial, but each customer environment introduces unique challenges, including policy requirements and physical infrastructure constraints. These factors often necessitate additional preparation steps.

In environments with multiple employees or shifts involved in the conversion, it becomes even more critical to track and verify completion of these tasks for each cluster. Skipping or inconsistently executing steps can lead to unreliable results, lack of transparency during the conversion process, and potentially a cascade of operational issues.

To address these challenges, the Nutanix Dial Task Tracker provides a streamlined solution for project teams and operations personnel to effectively track all tasks across clusters. This tool ensures that every step required to complete the project is documented and monitored, enabling the team to work as efficiently and effectively as possible while minimizing risks and avoiding errors.

This web based application runs with a basic IIS Web Server that uses Classic ASP.  It is backed with a Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition (MSDE) database.  Or, the database can be added to an existing Microsoft SQL Server instance.
